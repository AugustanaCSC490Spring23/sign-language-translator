  "instructions": "Start with both hands open, palms facing downward, and your fingers slightly apart. Bring your dominant hand up to your non-dominant hand, with your fingertips touching the palm of your non-dominant hand. While maintaining contact, move your dominant hand in a circular motion on the palm of your non-dominant hand, as if you were signing the letter 'B' in cursive. Repeat the circular motion a few times."
